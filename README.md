# ChousenFrontend

Improved frontend for [chousen-server](https://github.com/rawtoast/chousen-server)

Example instance available on Heroku [chousen](http://bit.ly/chousen), note that due to both the frontend and
backend being hosted on free Heroku instances initial reponse times will be very slow as the dyno wakes up.
